Wordpress plugin to create a custom HTML/CSS sitemap. Set your colors and fonts, then wrap any set of ULs in a shortcode to make an interactive sitemap. Uses Matt Everson's SlickMap CSS (astuteo.com); give him money if you dig this.

== Description ==

So, you want to make a pretty, interactive sitemap without JS, crazy formatting, or a lot of work? You can use Matt Everson's fantastic [SlickMap CSS](http://astuteo.com/slickmap/) inline, or include it in your theme. You could, if you want to generate a sitemap for a simple, single WP install site, use [Pengbo's Slick HTML Sitemap plugin](http://pengbos.com/blog/slick-html-sitemap) to generate that pretty quickly. But, if you're still reading and not downloading either of those, it probably means you want to create a custom, complex sitemap that may cover different sites, subdomains, etc... but you still don't want to make complex, brittle code on your WP site to put it together. So, use this plugin to get all of the benefits of SlickMap CSS by just wrapping a series of nested unordered lists with a shortcode. The settings allow you to pick your font and colors for each layer. Updating your map is as easy as changing the elements on your page/post in the visual editor. Easy!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `slickmap` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create a set of ULs, nested up to three levels deep on a page or in a post.
4. Wrap your UL block in `[slickmap]<your map>[/slickmap]`
5. Repeat wherever you want a pretty little sitemap.
